# Default Behavior

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

# Trouvaille Architectural & Design Rules

## 1. Iconography & Visual Aesthetics Rule (STRICT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NO NATIVE COLORED SYSTEM EMOJIS IN THE UI**
> Under no circumstances should native system colored emojis (e.g. 📊, ⚡, 🗓️, 🎯, 🔔, ⏱️, 🥧, 📈, 👥, 📱, etc.) be used as UI icons, dashboard widgets, modal toggles, button icons, or navigation items.

### Icon Guidelines:

- **Vector Icons Only**: Strictly use vector outline/duotone icons from `lucide-react`.
- **Stroke & Scale**: Standard stroke width is `strokeWidth={1.5}` or `strokeWidth={1.75}` with dimensions `14px` to `18px`.
- **Theme Variables**: Icons must inherit theme color variables (`var(--text-primary)`, `var(--text-secondary)`, `var(--text-tertiary)`) or be housed inside frosted squircle containers (`var(--glass-fill)` with `1px solid var(--glass-border)`).
- **Category Exceptions**: Emoji characters are permissible ONLY as user-customizable category avatars via `IconRenderer`, never as hardcoded application controls.

## 2. Monochrome Apple Luxury Theme System

- **Palette**: Strictly monochrome luxury glassmorphism.
  - **Dark Mode**: Deep obsidian `#09090c` / `#121214` with frosted white glass borders and accents.
  - **Light Mode**: Clean alabaster smoke `#f4f4f7` / `#ffffff` with matte black and translucent charcoal accents.
  - No vibrant rainbow accents (e.g. bright purple, neon green, orange) on core controls unless representing positive financial inflow (`var(--accent)`).
- **Typography**: Strictly geometric sans-serif (`Urbanist`). Avoid overly bold weights; prefer clean `font-medium`, `font-semibold`, and `font-light` with refined letter spacing.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-xl`, `backdrop-blur-2xl`), subtle borders (`var(--glass-border)`), and soft elevation shadows (`var(--shadow-card)`).

---

## 3. Modal & Customization Settings Layout Rule (STRICT)

- **Hierarchy Structure**:
  - Top Line: Feature Name (`text-[13px] font-semibold text-[var(--text-primary)]`).
  - Second Line: Concise functional description (`text-[11px] text-[var(--text-tertiary)]`).
  - Far Right: High-contrast Apple iOS toggle switch (`w-10 h-5.5` with `w-4.5 h-4.5` knob).
- **Active & Hover Aesthetics**:
  - Do NOT use harsh, thick, stark white outlines on active states.
  - Active ('on') states must use soft ambient frosted glass (`bg-white/[0.05] border border-white/14` with subtle inner hairline glow `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` in dark mode, and soft subtle elevation in light mode).
  - Off states must be gently dimmed (`opacity: 0.6`) so active items stand out gracefully.
- **Dynamic Notch, Dynamic Island & Floating Flyouts (STRICT)**:
  - NEVER use hardcoded top positions (e.g. `top-[24px]`) on `fixed` floating elements, flyouts, capsules, or status bars. The iPhone notch / Dynamic Island and status bar extend ~47px from top, which causes hardcoded top coordinates to collide directly with the camera notch and clock.
  - Floating capsules and top modals MUST compute vertical placement dynamically:
    `style={{ top: "max(calc(env(safe-area-inset-top, 0px) + 18px), 28px)" }}` paired with `left-4 right-4 max-w-md mx-auto` to center and clear all hardware cutouts cleanly across all device form factors.

## 4. Supabase Database & Schema Migration Rule (STRICT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EXPLICIT SCHEMA NOTIFICATION & SQL INJECTION WORKFLOW**
> Whenever a new feature, data persistence layer, or refactoring requires a new Supabase table, new column, enum, index, or Row Level Security (RLS) policy, the AI must NEVER assume migrations run automatically in the cloud.

### Migration Guidelines:

- **Immediate User Notification**: The AI must proactively and explicitly inform the user whenever any database schema change is needed so that the user can inject it into the Supabase SQL Editor.
- **Provide Ready-to-Run SQL**:
  - Always write an idempotent `.sql` script in `supabase/migrations/` (using `IF NOT EXISTS`, safe column alter checks, indexes, and user-scoped RLS policies).
  - Always provide the full, ready-to-run SQL code block directly in the chat response with copy-paste instructions for the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.
- **Graceful Offline / Local Fallbacks**: The frontend code must always include resilient offline/local caching or fallbacks (e.g. `localStorage` or default fallbacks) so the application remains fully functional without crashing even before the user executes the SQL script in Supabase.

## 5. Bottom Sheet & Sliding Panel Architecture Rule (STRICT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NO ARTIFICIAL INNER HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS (`max-h-[55vh]`, `max-h-[50vh]`, ETC.) IN BOTTOM SHEETS**
> Under no circumstances should inner contents or grids inside `BottomSheet` or bottom-sliding panels have arbitrary low height caps (such as `max-h-[55vh]`, `max-h-[52vh]`, `max-h-[60vh]`, `max-h-[340px]`) with inner `overflow-y-auto`.

### Architecture & Sizing Guidelines:

- **Single Unified Scroll Container**:
  - The parent `BottomSheet` component already manages `maxHeight: "92dvh"` and provides a single, smoothly decelerated scroll container (`min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto`).
  - Child components must NOT introduce nested scrollbars (`overflow-y-auto`) or artificial height caps (`max-h-[55vh]`) that cut the sheet off halfway up the screen. Children must render with natural vertical flow or `flex-1` so the sheet expands smoothly up to 92dvh.
- **Zero Bottom Cutoffs & iOS Home Indicator Inset**:
  - All bottom sheets and bottom-docked modals must always respect the iOS home swipe bar by enforcing a generous bottom inset:
    `paddingBottom: "max(calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) + 12px), 24px)"` (or `pb-[max(calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom,0px)+12px),20px)]`).
  - The bottommost action buttons, pills, or cards must never be clipped, obstructed, or placed flush against the bottom edge of mobile displays.

## 6. Strict Non-Mixed Localization Rule (STRICT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ZERO BILINGUAL MIXING ("NO GADO-GADO" LOCALIZATION)**
> The application must be 100% pure Indonesian when `isIndonesian === true` and 100% pure English when `isIndonesian === false`.

### Localization Guidelines:
- **No Mixed Phrasing**: Never mix English terms into Indonesian sentences or badges (e.g. DO NOT write "Pintasan Back Tap (Glass UI)", "1-Tap", "Setup", "Auto", "Number", "Text", "presets", "Done" alongside Indonesian text).
- **Comprehensive Conditional Branching**: Every user-facing string, pill label, button, modal title, placeholder, tooltip, and instructional step MUST conditionally branch:
  `{isIndonesian ? "Terjemahan Bahasa Indonesia Baku" : "Pure English Formulation"}`
- **Standardized Terminology**:
  - *Shortcuts*: Pintasan
  - *Presets*: Preset bawaan / Preset tersimpan
  - *Number*: Angka / Nominal
  - *Text*: Teks / Catatan
  - *Done*: Selesai
  - *Setup*: Atur / Konfigurasi
  - *1-Tap*: 1-Ketukan
  - *Auto*: Otomatis
  - *Voice*: Suara / Dikte
  - *Ways to Add*: Metode Pencatatan

## 7. Strict Monochrome Luxury Color Invariant (STRICT)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NO VIBRANT / RAINBOW COLORS (NO EMERALD, AMBER, BLUE, PURPLE, ORANGE) IN UI CONTROLS & MODALS**
> UI controls, icons, checkmarks, badges, status pills, and instructional text MUST remain strictly monochrome luxury glassmorphism.

### Palette Guidelines:
- **Zero Colored Utility Classes**: Never use `text-emerald-500`, `text-amber-500`, `text-blue-500`, `bg-emerald-500`, `text-yellow-500`, etc., for icons, checkmarks, buttons, step numbers, or badges.
- **Monochrome Success & Status**: Success checkmarks must inherit `text-[var(--text-primary)]`, `text-white`, or `text-zinc-400`.
- **System Variables Only**: All elements must use `var(--text-primary)`, `var(--text-secondary)`, `var(--text-tertiary)`, `var(--glass-border)`, and `var(--glass-fill)`.
- **Sole Exception**: Positive financial inflow in cashflow charts / balance metrics (`var(--accent)`), never on buttons, icons, or badges in setting sheets.
